Who does not love pancakes for breakfast?, especially on a Sunday morning when it is gloomy outside and you need a good reason to go out of the bed. Since that we are on a low carb diet I was looking for a recipe to give me this kind of good morning. 
This is a simple recipe, it takes less than half hour to prepare it and it is so tasty.

1 cup almond flour
1/4 cup dry coconut 
1 tablespoon liquid sweetener or 1 tablespoon stevia 
2 egg
1/4 cup greek yogurt

#. Let the batter leaven for at least 15 minutes
#. Melt the butter in a fry pan with medium heat, used a ladle to pour the batter on it when the fry pan is warm and form a pancake. Once the batter starts bubbling on the up side use a spatula to flip the pancake over and cook on the other side.
