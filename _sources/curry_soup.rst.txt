- Type: main

Let's talk about curry... I really LOVE curry!. I think is one of the most amazing spice in all the world. 
For years my curry experiences were about some main plate with some meat with veggies and white basmati rice as a side plate accompanied with curry sauce. Have you ever try to make the "scarpetta" with curry sauce and naan or chapati bread?.
During my last journey in The Netherlands my brother in law invited us a "piece of heaven" in liquid state... curry soup!. He explained me how to make it and I decided to try my own version. You can make it with chicken or fish.
If you decide to make it with fish, I recommend to use codfish filets or sea bream cut in dices. You can serve it as main plate if you reduce the coconut milk and you can serve it with white rice or some chapati bread if you are not in a low carb diet.
 

Ingredients
-----------
- Half medium chicken breast or 2 codfish/sea bream filets 
- indian curry powder (at least 3 tablespoons)
- 100 ml chicken or fish broth (depending if you make the soup with chicken or fish)

- 1/2 small red bell pepper
