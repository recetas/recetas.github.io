- Serves: 4

- Type: main


Background
----------
This is one of my mom's recipes. I learnt to prepare it when I was a teenager and I cooked from time to time and sometimes I like to vary it with different ingredients (for example: adding some diced gouda cheese, white sauce, etc) and it is really tasty and help you to come out with a nice meal. 

Ingredients
-----------
- 4 medium zucchini
- 1 egg
- 1 shallot
- 2 garlic cloves (or garlic paste)
- 500 grams minced meat (I prefer beef)
- 1 teaspoon grounded cumin
- 1 tablespoon paprika powder
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Butter
- Olive oil
- 1 tablespoon dried parsley
- 50 grams parmesan cheese
- 1 tablespoon Worcester sauce

Steps
-----

#. Cut the zucchini vertically in half
#. Steam the zucchini. Remove carefully the seeds, leaving some space in the top and bottom of the zucchini.
#. Place the zucchini on a greased oven dish, with the zucchini skin down.
