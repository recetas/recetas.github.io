Zucchini cannelloni

- Serves: 4

- Type: main


Background
----------
Who doesn't like Italian food?, I have to admit that I am not a such big fan of it (and this is why my citizenship might be revoked) but I like to eat some Italian food from time to time, especially because it is simple to cook, but since my partner and I are in a low carb diet, Italian food is kind of forbidden in this house. 
To avoid lack of Italian food, I found some alternatives online and to use grilled zucchini instead of pasta -for lasagna (I will upgrade the recipe soon), cannelloni- is a good idea and it is really healthy and you will not be there thinking about all the km you must to run to feel light again. 
I used less ricotta cheese that in some recipes you will find online, believe me, in this case less is better.
