Background
----------
People usually thinks that Italy is the land of garlic butter and (yeah... Pizza Hut's fault), I am sorry to say that that is not true. I tried the most amazing garlic butter on my Belgium vacation a few years ago and I was trying several times to replicate it. Finally I went close!, close enough to share with you this recipe.


Ingredients
-----------
- 150 grams unsalted german butter
- 1 lemon zest
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 4 garlic gloves
- 1/2 teaspoon dry rosemary 
- 1/2 teaspoon dry thyme
- 1 teaspoon parsley (dry is ok too)


Steps
-----

#. Put the butter in a small bowl and heat it in the microwave for 30 seconds at 750W. 
#. Add to the butter salt, pepper, parsley
#. Grind the rosemary and thyme, add to the melted butter
#. Grate the lemon zest and add to the melted butter
#. Slice the garlic gloves, add to the the butter bowl
#. Cut a piece of baking paper, pour the mixture in the middle and roll it.
#. Refrigerate the butter roll for a least half hour before to use.
