- Serves: 2

- Type: Side dish


Background
----------
As mentioned in the sour cream recipe (:doc:`sour_cream`), I become a big fan of jacket potatoes in Munich. Since then I try to make this delicious side dish when is possible no matter the cholesterol in the cream.

Ingredients
-----------
- 2 medium potatoes
- 150 ml sour cream (:doc:`sour_cream`)
- Butter
- Salt and pepper to taste

Steps
-----

#. Wash and dry the potatoes
#. Smear the potatoes with butter (if you have garlic butter it is tastier!)
#. Salt and sprinkle some pepper on them
#. Preheat the oven at 160Â°C
#. Wrap the potatoes with aluminium foil
#. Place them in a oven tin and bake them for 40 minutes
#. Once out of the oven, open the aluminium foil and make them cold down for 10-15 minutes
#. In the top surface, cut a cross in the potato and fill with sour cream.
#. Wrap the potatoes again and serve.
