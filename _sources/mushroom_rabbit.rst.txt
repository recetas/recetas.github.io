Background
----------
Today's holiday. I had a rabbit loin to cook and I was thinking to do something different than :doc:`rabbit_mustard_sauce`. So, I decided to look for new recipes online... but after pressing enter my screen was full of cute-fluffy bunnies pictures. Oh dear!, how I will continue with my programs!It was challenging, in one hand guilt feelings and in the other hunger. I decided to continue with my original plans after my boyfriend and I had a talk about life. 
I found different recipes and all of them seemed tasty so I decided to take the best part of each of one and make my own one. I have to say it was so tasty and so far I will use it more often (if I will decide to eat rabbit again). My advice is:  to be precise when googling for recipes that involves cute fluffy animals.
